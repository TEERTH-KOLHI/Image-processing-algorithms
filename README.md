# Image Processing Web Application

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a web-based application built using **React.js** for the frontend and **Digital Image Processing Algorithms** in the backend to process images. It allows users to:

- Upload an image they want to process.
- Apply powerful image processing algorithms to the uploaded image.
- Show the processed Image.

Explore a hands-on experience of real-world image processing algorithms through this interactive platform!

## ✨ Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design to make image processing easy.
- **Multiple Processing Algorithms**: Includes techniques like Gamma Correction, Histogram Equalization, and more.
- **Fast and Reliable**: Quick image uploads and processing.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works on all modern browsers.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Image Processing Algorithms implemented in JavaScript (or specify the technology used).

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Upload an image, apply the processing algorithm, and view/download the results.
